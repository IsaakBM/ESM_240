# Preface {.unnumbered}

This eBook was written and compiled by **Isaac Brito-Morales** (*ibrito\@conservation.org*) as part of the *Climate Change Biology* module within the ESM240 course.

The goal is simple: to help students and early-career scientists navigate the world of climate models — not to turn them into modelers, but to make sure they know where to find information, how to use it responsibly, and how to interpret it within an ecological and conservation context.

All code and examples are provided for educational purposes.\

No guarantees that every line of code will run perfectly — as one of my mentors used to say, *“that’s what learning (and debugging) is for.”*
