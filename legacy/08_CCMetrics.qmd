# Climate Change Metrics

## Introduction

The aim of this tutorial is to provide a worked example of how to calculate climate change metrics using CMIP6 models. The climate-change metrics used in this example are **Climate Velocity** [@burrows2011] and a **Relative Climate Exposure** index [@brito-morales2022].

This dataset contains a raster-stack file in format **.tif** of monthly sea surface temperature (tos) for the GFDL-CM4 model under a SSP5-5.8 emission scenario. The model goes from 2015 until 2100.

## Data import

Load the required packages and the data.

```{r, message = FALSE, warning = FALSE, eval = FALSE, out.width = "40%"}
# load packages
  library(raster)
  library(VoCC)
  library(stringr)
  library(dplyr)
```

## Climate Velocity (VoCC)

*Climate velocity* is a vector that describes the speed and direction that a point on a gridded map would need to move to remain static in climate space (e.g., to maintain an isoline of a given variable in a univariate environment) under climate change. From an ecological perspective, *climate velocity* can be conceptualized as the speed and direction in which a species would need to move to maintain its current climate conditions under climate change. For this reason, *climate velocity* can be considered to represent the potential exposure to climate change faced by a species if the climate moves beyond the physiological tolerance of a local population. See[@brito-morales2018].

[Install the R package: GitHub Repo](https://github.com/JorGarMol/VoCC)

```{r, out.width = "100%", echo = FALSE}
  knitr::include_graphics("images/VoCC_01.png")
```

To calculate *climate velocity* the R package `VoCC` provides a comprehensive collection of functions that calculate climate velocity and related metrics from their initial formulation to the latest developments. See [Garcia Molinos et al. 2019](https://besjournals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/2041-210X.13295).

```{r, out.width = "100%", echo = FALSE}
  knitr::include_graphics("images/VoCC_02.png")
```

```{r, eval = FALSE, out.width = "40%", eval = FALSE}
# Load the monthly raster object
  rs <- terra::rast("data/tos_Omon_GFDL-ESM4_ssp585_r1i1p1f1_gr_201501-203412.tif")
# Establish the time period of interest (if applicable)
  from = 2015
  to = 2034
# If Raster is monthly, get annual mean
  index <- rep(1:nlyr(rs), each = 12, length.out = nlyr(rs))
  rs <- raster::stackApply(x = raster::stack(rs), indices = index, fun = mean)

# Calculate VoCC
  # Temporal trend (slope)
    slp <- tempTrend(rs, th = 10)
  # Spatial gradient (gradient)
    grad <- spatGrad(rs, th = 0.0001, projected = FALSE)
# VoCC local gradient
  vocc <- gVoCC(slp, grad)
  vocc$voccMag[] <- ifelse(is.infinite(vocc$voccMag[]), NA, vocc$voccMag[]) # replace inf with NAs
```
